# React Native Flow
React Native Flow is a starter project for building React Native apps. It provides a solid foundation with a pre-configured folder structure, Redux for state management, authentication flow, and navigation based on the authentication state. This project helps you jump-start your React Native development by focusing on best practices for scalable app architecture, authentication flow, and clean code structure. 
## Features 
- **Folder Structure:** 
A scalable and organized folder structure for better maintainability. 
- **Redux Setup:** Pre-configured Redux for efficient state management. 
- **Authentication Flow:** A complete authentication flow for user login and registration.
- **Navigation:** Navigation setup based on authentication state (authenticated and unauthenticated users). 
- **React Navigation:** Pre-installed and set up for seamless navigation in your app. ## Installation 
### Prerequisites Ensure you have the following installed: 
- **Node.js** (preferably the latest stable version) 
- **Android Studio** (for Android development) or **Xcode** (for iOS development) 
### Step 1: 
- Clone the Repository 

  - ``` git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-native-flow.git```
  - ``` cd react-native-flow ``` 
### Step 2: Install Dependencies 
- ``` npm install ``` 
### Step 3: 
Set Up Android or iOS Environment Follow the official React Native documentation to set up your Android or iOS development environment: - [Android Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup#android-development-environment) - [iOS Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup#ios-development-environment) 
### Step 4: Run the Project For Android:
 -  For android``` npx react-native run-android ``` For iOS: ``` npx react-native run-ios ``` 
## Folder Structure 
The folder structure is designed to keep the project modular and easy to scale. Here's a quick overview: 
- /src 
  - /assets        :```  Images, fonts, and other assets``` 
  - /components     :``` Reusable components```
  - /redux          :``` Redux store, actions, reducers ```
  - /navigation:``` Navigation setup (stack, tab, etc.)``` 
  - /screens:        ``` Different screens of the app``` 
  - /utils:         ``` Helper functions and utilities ``` 
  - /services:       ``` API and authentication service ``` 
## Redux Setup 
Redux is set up to manage global app state. The store is configured with reducers, middleware, and actions. You can easily add more reducers and actions as your app grows.
- **Actions**: Defined in `/redux/actions/` 
- **Reducers**: Defined in `/redux/reducers/` 
- **Store**: The central store is configured in `/redux/store.js` 
## Authentication Flow 
The app includes a simple authentication flow with: 
- **Login Screen**: User can log in with their credentials. 
- **Registration Screen**: New users can sign up. 
- **AuthContext**: Tracks user authentication state. 
- **Protected Routes**: Screens that are only accessible after authentication. 

The authentication flow is connected with Redux to manage the logged-in user state across the app. 
## Navigation Navigation 
is set up using **React Navigation**. It includes: 
- **Authenticated Stack**: A stack of screens that users can access after logging in. 
- **Unauthenticated Stack**: A stack of screens shown to users before they log in (e.g., login and registration). 

The navigation stack changes dynamically based on the authentication state.
